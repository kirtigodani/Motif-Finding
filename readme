STATEMENT-1 
Given a set of m DNA sequences each of length n –nucleotides ,find the pattern p of length l that is repeated in all the sequences.

STATEMENT-2
Givan a set of l-mers ,construct the set of most probable consensus strings (motif) through profiling.

INTRODUCTION:-
Many immunity genes in the genome have strings that are reminiscent of TCGGGGATTTCC, located upstream of the genes’ start. These short strings, called NF-κB binding sites, are examples of regulatory motifs. These regulatory motifs turn on immunity and other genes. 
Proteins known as transcription factors bind to these motifs, encouraging RNA polymers to transcribe the downstream genes.
Motif finding is the problem of discovering such motifs without any prior knowledge of how the motif looks.

Figure represents seven 32-nucleotide DNA sequences generated randomly. Also shown in below figure are the same sequences with the “hidden” pattern 
P = ATGCAAC of length l = 7 implanted at random positions.

Suppose you do not know what the pattern P is, or where in each sequence it has been implanted. We have to reconstruct P by analyzing the DNA sequences.We could simply count the number of times each l-mer, or string of length l, occurs in the sample. Since there are only 7 · (32 + 8) = 280 nucleotides in the sample, it is unlikely that any 8-mer other than the implanted pattern appears more than once.9 After counting all 8-mer occurrences we will observe that, although most 8-mers appear in the sample just once (with a few appearing twice), there is one 8-mer that appears in the sample suspiciously many times—seven or more. This overrepresented 8-mer is the pattern P we are trying to ﬁnd.

From  above example, to alignment matrix, to proﬁle, and, ﬁnally, to consensus string. If s = (8,19,3,5,31,27,15) is an array of starting positions for 8-mers, then Score(s) = 5 + 5 + 6 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 6 = 42.

Each node in a ternary search tree contains only 3 pointers- 1. The left pointer points to the node whose value is less than the    value in the current node. 2. The equal pointer points to the node whose value is equal to the value in the current node. 3. The right pointer points to the node whose value is greater than the value in the current node.
Apart from above three pointers, each node has a field to indicate data(character in case of dictionary) and another field to mark end of a string.
